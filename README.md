# Health Monitoring App

This repository contains a comprehensive health monitoring application developed to track SpO2 levels, pulse rate, and body temperature using sensors connected to an Arduino Nano. The application communicates with the Arduino Nano via Bluetooth to provide real-time monitoring and analysis on a mobile device.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Android application development
- **Kotlin**: Android application development
- **XML**: Android UI design
- **Bluetooth**: Communication between Arduino Nano and mobile app

## Hardware Components

- **Arduino Nano**: Microcontroller used for sensor data acquisition and processing.
- **SpO2 sensor**: Measures oxygen saturation in blood.
- **Pulse rate sensor**: Measures heart rate.
- **Temperature sensor**: Measures body temperature.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of SpO2 levels, pulse rate, and body temperature.
- **Data Visualization**: Visual representation of health parameters for easy analysis.
- **Bluetooth Communication**: Wireless transmission of sensor data to the mobile app.
- **User Interface**: Intuitive UI design for easy interaction and data visualization.
